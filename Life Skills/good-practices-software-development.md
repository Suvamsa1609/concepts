# Good Practices for Software Development

## Question 1 : Which point(s) were new to you?

- Using group chats instead of private messages so everyone stays updated was something I didn’t focus on earlier.
- Joining meetings a few minutes early to talk to teammates and build a connection was new for me.
- Blocking distractions using apps like Boosted or Freedom, and learning about "deep work" to stay focused was also new.

## Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

- **What I need to improve:** Asking clear and detailed questions when I’m stuck.
- **How I’ll improve:**
  - I’ll explain the issue clearly and mention what I already tried.
  - I’ll add screenshots or short videos to show the problem.
  - I’ll use tools like CodeSandbox or GitHub Gists to share code.
  - I’ll look at how people ask questions in open-source projects to learn how to do it better.
