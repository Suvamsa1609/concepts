**2. What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?**

If I face or witness any form of sexual harassment, I would:

- **Assert boundaries** by clearly stating that the behavior is unwelcome, if safe to do so  
- **Document the incident** with date, time, location, and details of what happened  
- **Report the incident** to the designated internal authority or complaint mechanism  
- **Support others** who may be affected by encouraging them to speak up and offering help  
- **Maintain confidentiality** and ensure respectful handling of the situation  
- **Avoid ignoring or minimizing** the behavior, recognizing its potential impact on individuals and the workplace
