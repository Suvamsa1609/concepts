## Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

**Question 1: What was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

- The most interesting idea in this video was doing just one push-up after brushing your teeth. It’s so small that it’s easy to do, and over time it builds a real habit. The key is starting tiny, linking it to something you already do, and feeling good about it. That’s how small actions grow into big changes.

## Using Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message

**Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?**

- B = MAP means:  
  **B** = Behavior  
  **M** = Motivation (your desire)  
  **A** = Ability (how easy it is)  
  **P** = Prompt (reminder)  
- To make a habit stick: Start when motivation is high, make the habit very easy, and use a clear prompt.

**Question 3: Why is it important to celebrate after doing a habit?**

- When you celebrate (like smiling, saying “yes!”), your brain feels happy. That happiness helps your brain remember the habit and makes you want to do it again. If you celebrate it, your brain makes it a habit.

**Question 4: What was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

- BJ Fogg said, “Help yourself do what you already want to do.” That means: Don’t force habits you hate. Instead, build small habits around things you already like or care about. This makes them easier to do and stick with. When you enjoy the habit, you’ll naturally keep doing it without needing much motivation. Make habits fit you, not the other way around.

**Question 5: What is the book's perspective about Identity?**

- The book says your identity shapes habits. Instead of focusing on what you want to do, think about who you want to become. Start saying things like, “I’m the kind of person who exercises” or “I’m someone who writes every day.” Tiny actions build a sense of identity, and that identity then supports bigger habit changes. Change your identity first, and your habits will follow.

**Question 6: What is the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?**

- The book says: Make the habit so small and simple that it’s hard to fail. Don’t try to do too much—just shrink the habit. For example, instead of “read for 30 minutes,” start with “open the book” or “read one line.” The easier it is, the more likely you'll do it, even on busy or lazy days. Start tiny, keep it easy, and let it grow naturally.

**Question 7: What is the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?**

- To break a bad habit, the book suggests making it harder or more annoying to do. Increase the effort, time, or steps needed. For example, if you want to stop checking your phone, put it in another room or log out of your apps. When a habit is harder, you're less likely to keep doing it. Make bad habits difficult, so they slowly fade away.

## Reflection

**Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?**

- **Habit**: Waking up early and revising coding topics.
- **Cue (obvious)**: Keep your laptop or notes near your bed and put your alarm far so you have to get up.  
- **Attractive**: Make a small and colorful list of what to revise.  
- **Easy**: Just revise 1 concept or 1 page after waking up.  
- **Satisfying**: Mark it done on a calendar or say “Yes! I did it!”

**Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?**

- **Habit**: Sleeping late at night.
- **Cue (invisible)**: Stop using your phone or laptop at least 30 minutes before bed.  
- **Unattractive**: Think about how lazy, tired, or unproductive you feel the next morning.  
- **Hard**: Put your phone far from your bed and set a bedtime alarm to remind you to sleep.  
- **Unsatisfying**: Note down how late sleep messes up your next day — like missing your morning goals or feeling low.
> Cut off screen time, remind yourself why sleep matters, and make late nights feel like a loss.
